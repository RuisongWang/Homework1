    <h1>Have you tried these 40 types of Pizza?</h1>
    <img src="images/pizza.jpg" alt="40 Types of Pizza you could find here.">
    <p>Welcome to Pizzaland, home of 40 distinct kinds of pizza! Some you’ll know quite well, some are regional specialties (shoutouts to New Haven, St. Louis and, of course, Chicago) and some are one-off examples that actually exist. You’d be hard-pressed to find the deep-fried Scottish pizza crunch outside of its native land, and jumbo slices are definitely a Washington, D.C.–area creation. Some aren’t even pizza at all — sushi, Mexican and smoked salmon are more riffs on an idea than legitimate varietals, and whether calzone and stromboli belong to the pizza category is up for debate (but we wanted to illustrate ’em, so what the hell). Whether you do the “fold ‘n cram,” cut politely with a knife and fork or consume your slices any way in between, there’s no wrong way to eat these 40 pizzas.</p>
